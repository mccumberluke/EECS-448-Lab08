                <p>&emsp; The Kansas City Cheifs are the best team in football for the past 4 years in a row. This is insane, I remember as a kid screaming at my TV because we were such a horrible football team. Ever since we drafted Patrick Mahomes the greatest Quaterback for the past 4 years the Kansas city, he has turned this franchise and city around. The Cheifs also made him the highest paid Quarterback in the history of the NFL. The past 4 years have made this town enjoy football more and bring winning sports back to Kansas city like it should have been all along. </p>
